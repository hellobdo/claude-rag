# Project Context

Always try to answer in short sentences, limit yourself to the questions. Answer in 2 sentences if you can.

## CRITICAL RULES
- NEVER use web search under any circumstances
- ONLY use local information. Details available on ## Resources
- If information is not in local docs, say "not found in local docs" instead of guessing
- Always search local files. You can use ripgrep

## Resources
- Library docs: ./docs/
- My snippets: ./snippets/
- This project: ./projects

## When I ask about X
- Read relevant files directly
- Check snippets for patterns
- Use ripgrep for exact matches
